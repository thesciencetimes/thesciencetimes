                        <p> Alzheimer's is a disease characterized by memory loss and impaired reasoning.
                            It's scary because there is no cure; once a person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's,
                            it progressively worsens until they lose most of their memories.
                            Many drugs have been developed to slow down its progression,
                            but they are ineffective in the long run due to the rapid changes occurring inside the
                            patient’s
                            brain. Since treating Alzheimer’s is challenging,
                            it’s important to take preventive measures early on.</p>

                        <h2 class="article_subhead">What Causes Alzheimer's?</h2>
                        <p>In a healthy human brain, millions of neurons transmit signals to one another. These signals
                            cause the chemicals at the end of the neuron to be released and spread across the synapse to
                            a neighboring neuron. This signal flow is why we are able to see, move, think, feel, and
                            memorize. However, in individuals with Alzheimer's, this neural communication breaks down.
                        </p>

                        <p>During communication, neurons release small peptides called
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">amyloid beta</span>. Normally, amyloid
                            beta is cleared away by microglia, which regulates the release of chemicals and phagocytizes
                            waste products. However, when too much amyloid beta is released or not enough is cleared
                            away, it begins to pile up in the synapse and form amyloid plaques. These plaques are
                            dangerous because they hinder the communication between neurons. In addition, this
                            disruption hyper-activates microglia and initiates an inflammatory response. Inflammation is
                            a natural defense mechanism, but in the context of Alzheimer's disease, this heightened
                            immune response contributes to the ongoing damage and deterioration of neural tissue.
                        </p>
                        <!--<img></img>-->
                        <p>Another marker for Alzheimer’s Disease is
                            <span style="font-weight: bold">tau tangles</span>. Tau is found inside neurons and is
                            responsible for maintaining neuron structure. However, in Alzheimer’s brain, tau molecules
                            stick to one another and form threads that join together to create massive tangles. These
                            tangles damage the neuron structures and hinder their abilities to communicate with each
                            other.
                        </p>
                        <p>As communication between neurons falters, the brain experiences a decline in cognitive
                            function. For example, people might have a harder time finding the right words and making
                            sound decisions. The cumulative impact of these disruptions ultimately contributes to the
                            progression of Alzheimer’s.</p>

                        <h2 class="article_subhead">How Does Alzheimer's Spread in the Brain?</h2>
                        <p>In Alzheimer’s disease, cognitive degeneration usually begins in the epidural cortex and
                            hippocampus, the parts of the brain that form new memories and consolidate information. This
                            is why the early symptoms of Alzheimer's are frequent forgetfulness. At this stage, the
                            person will start asking questions about where they put their phones or whether they have
                            had lunch yet. Next, the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for language,
                            problem-solving, and social behavior, becomes damaged. Individuals may become disoriented in
                            familiar surroundings and have difficulty finding their way home. Individuals may also
                            struggle to find words during conversations and have frequent pauses when expressing their
                            thoughts.</p>
                        <p>
                            As the disease expands to other parts of the brain, the brain loses its normal functions.
                            Eventually, there comes a point where they can no longer perform basic tasks and must depend
                            entirely on others for physical support. Alzheimer's not only erodes one’s identity as an
                            individual but also their fundamental identity as a human being.

                        <h3 class="article_sub_subhead">Sleep</h3>
                        <p>Research by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that an insufficient amount of
                            sleep (less than six hours) increases the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease.
                            This is especially true for people aged 50s and 60s. During sleep, the glial cells in
                            the brain clear out waste products like amyloid beta plaques. However, if people don’t
                            get enough sleep, this whole process can be impeded and more harmful substances can
                            accumulate in the brain over time. With amyloid beta piling up, the condition of
                            Alzheimer's exacerbates. <a href="source_under" class="citation_note"><sup>[5]</sup>
                            </a></p>
                        <h3 class="article_sub_subhead">Brain exercise</h3>
                        <p> People who engage in mentally stimulating activities are less likely to develop Alzheimer's.
                            This is because they can build many neural connections by learning new things or
                            participating in challenging cognitive tasks. So even if they have a disease like
                            Alzheimer's and damaged synapses, they have plenty of other synapses they can rely on to
                            remember something. </p>
                        <p>In my opinion, Alzheimer's is the most heartbreaking disease. Being unable to express
                            yourself because you forgot who you are and who you used to be. Not being able to remember
                            your loved ones even if they are physically next to you. You may have a vague sense of who
                            they were but cannot feel the love coming from them, nor will you be able to love them back.
                            When you are dying, you would want to look back on happy moments and unforgettable memories
                            you shared with them. However, Alzheimer's renders the unforgettable “forgettable” beyond
                            your control and willingness. It’s almost as if you become an empty eggshell, with an inner
                            part that once defined “you” completely gone. </p>
                        <p>To avoid such consequences, we must take preventive measures early on. Despite numerous
                            research and efforts put into finding a cure for Alzheimer’s, one has not been developed
                            yet. As the brain is a complex organ that behaves in unpredictable ways, slightly
                            differently for each person, finding a cure that can be applied to the general population
                            remains a challenging task. Even if a cure develops one day, we need to acknowledge that the
                            best way is not to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in the first place. Changing simple habits,
                            such as going to bed a few hours early, will make a huge difference. It’s never too late to
                            change your habit- so if you are reading this now, what about going to sleep before midnight
                            today?</p>
