                            <p>Alzheimer's is a disease characterized by
                                memory loss and impaired reasoning. It's
                                scary
                                because there is no cure; once a person is
                                diagnosed with Alzheimer's, it progressively
                                worsens until they lose most of their
                                memories. Many drugs have been developed to
                                slow
                                down its progression, but they are
                                ineffective in the long run due to the rapid
                                changes
                                occurring inside the patient’s brain. Since
                                treating Alzheimer’s is challenging, it’s
                                important to take preventive measures early
                                on.</p>

                            <p>In a healthy human brain, millions of neurons
                                transmit signals to one another. These
                                signals
                                cause the chemicals at the end of the neuron
                                to be released and spread across the
                                synapse to
                                a neighboring neuron. This signal flow is
                                why we are able to see, move, think, feel,
                                and
                                memorize. However, in individuals with
                                Alzheimer's, this neural communication
                                breaks
                                down.
                            </p>

                            <p>During communication, neurons release small
                                peptides called

                            <p>As communication between neurons falters, the
                                brain experiences a decline in cognitive

                                making
                                sound decisions. The cumulative impact of
                                these disruptions ultimately contributes to
                                the
                                progression of Alzheimer’s.</p>

                                frequent forgetfulness. At this stage, the
                                person will start asking questions about
                                where they put their phones or whether they
                                have
                                had lunch yet. Next, the cerebral cortex,
                                which is responsible for language,
                                problem-solving, and social behavior,
                                becomes damaged. Individuals may become
                                disoriented in
                                familiar surroundings and have difficulty
                                finding their way home. Individuals may also
                                struggle to find words during conversations
                                and have frequent pauses when expressing
                                their
                                thoughts.</p>
                            <p>
                                As the disease expands to other parts of the
                                brain, the brain loses its normal
                                functions.
                                Eventually, there comes a point where they
                                can no longer perform basic tasks and must
                                depend
                                entirely on others for physical support.
                                Alzheimer's not only erodes one’s identity
                                as
                                an
                                individual but also their fundamental
                                identity as a human being.

                                Alzheimer's?</h2>
                            <h3 class="article_sub_subhead">Sleep</h3>
                            <p>Research by the National Institutes of Health
                                (NIH) found that an insufficient amount of
                                sleep (less than six hours) increases the
                                likelihood of developing Alzheimer's
                                disease.
                                This is especially true for people aged 50s
                                and 60s. During sleep, the glial cells in
                                the brain clear out waste products like
                                amyloid beta plaques. However, if people
                                don’t
                                get enough sleep, this whole process can be
                                impeded and more harmful substances can
                                accumulate in the brain over time. With
                                amyloid beta piling up, the condition of
                                Alzheimer's exacerbates. </p>
                            <h3 class="article_sub_subhead">Brain
                                exercise</h3>
                            <p> People who engage in mentally stimulating
                                activities are less likely to develop
                                Alzheimer's.
                                This is because they can build many neural
                                connections by learning new things or
                                participating in challenging cognitive
                                tasks. So even if they have a disease like
                                Alzheimer's and damaged synapses, they have
                                plenty of other synapses they can rely on to
                                remember something. </p>
                            <p>In my opinion, Alzheimer's is the most
                                heartbreaking disease. Being unable to
                                express
                                yourself because you forgot who you are and
                                who you used to be. Not being able to
                                remember
                                your loved ones even if they are physically
                                next to you. You may have a vague sense of
                                who
                                they were but cannot feel the love coming
                                from them, nor will you be able to love them
                                back.
                                When you are dying, you would want to look
                                back on happy moments and unforgettable
                                memories
                                you shared with them. However, Alzheimer's
                                renders the unforgettable “forgettable”
                                beyond
                                your control and willingness. It’s almost as
                                if you become an empty eggshell, with an
                                inner
                                part that once defined “you” completely
                                gone. </p>
                            <p>To avoid such consequences, we must take
                                preventive measures early on. Despite
                                numerous
                                research and efforts put into finding a cure
                                for Alzheimer’s, one has not been developed
                                yet. As the brain is a complex organ that
                                behaves in unpredictable ways, slightly
                                differently for each person, finding a cure
                                that can be applied to the general
                                population
                                remains a challenging task. Even if a cure
                                develops one day, we need to acknowledge
                                that
                                the
                                best way is not to be diagnosed with
                                Alzheimer’s in the first place. Changing
                                simple
                                habits,
                                such as going to bed a few hours early, will
                                make a huge difference. It’s never too late
                                to
                                change your habit- so if you are reading
                                this now, what about going to sleep before
                                midnight
                                today?</p>
